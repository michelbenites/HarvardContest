The main purpose here is to show how the scale command works in a dataset. In statistics it is very important to transform the data in Z-scale before analyzing them, thus obtaining a normalization of the dataset. When you have data of different magnitudes, for instance kilometers, seconds, temperature etc. makes all sense converts them into a more homogenous distribution facilitating the analysis and the input of these data in some algorithms.
Graphically I'm showing a dataset that was created in a random way that is gradually being staggered (steps of 10%). Initially we have for the X axis values between -5 and 5 and for Y values between -25 and 25. At the end of the procedure of scaling the dataset, we will have both X and Y values between -2 and 2, without losing the proportionality.
